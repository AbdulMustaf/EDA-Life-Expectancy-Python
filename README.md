# EDA-Life-Expectancy-Python

## Overview
This repository contains an exploratory data analysis (EDA) project on global life expectancy data. The analysis investigates key factors influencing life expectancy across countries, including health, economic, and demographic variables. The project is implemented using Python in Jupyter Notebooks.

   - Reads a CSV dataset directly from a URL or local file.
   - Utilizes `pandas` for efficient data handling.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis**:
   - Provides descriptive statistics of the dataset.
   - Visualizes trends and relationships using `matplotlib` and `seaborn`.

3. **Key Insights**:
   - Analyzes the relationship between life expectancy and factors such as:
     - GDP
     - Population
     - Healthcare expenditure
     - Literacy rates

4. **Error Handling**:
   - Handles missing values and ensures data integrity.
   - Includes debugging for common issues (e.g., incorrect data types, invalid values).
